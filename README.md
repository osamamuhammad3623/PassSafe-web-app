# PassSafe-web-app

* PassSafe is a password manager web app build with Django and SQLite database.
* I've used PostgreSQL db but for some issues in deployment, I had to go back to SQLite.
* I used a free Front-end template (https://templatemo.com/tm-538-digital-trend) and modified it for learning purposes.
* Live demo: http://passsafe.pythonanywhere.com/
